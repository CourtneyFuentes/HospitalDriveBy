Project: Hospital Drive By
Group's repository:  https://github.com/CourtneyFuentes/HospitalDriveBy



What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?
The physics involved with making an ice-like effect were interesting to look into, as well as the respawning mechanic they
implpemented. It was a very good game! 

 

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?
In this game, you are a nurse ship shooting cures at infected zombie-like patients. This game reflects the infection and 
virus theme, displaying it through the hospital setting and the virus-ridden patients. 

 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
I would definently try to impliment a respawn mechanic in my future games, as theirs seems to work well. 

 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
I love the sliding on the ice, but it was very hard to manage, so perhaps ironing out the mechanic to be more intuitive
to the player would be a good idea. 
 


Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
The code looks clear and easy to read, with notes describing what parts do. 

 

Is it clear that every group member participated?
Based on the roles in the ReadMe, it seems every student played an even role. 

 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
This repository has a license with all contributors names.

 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
This group's ReadMe was already very descriptive, but the creators mentioned they all worked on the story of the game,
and I would like to see more of that story explained. 
 


Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
This game is very cute and i would love to play it with even more levels if it were to become a full game in the future.



How many of your points would you allocate to this project?
I would allocate 2 of the 5 points.
