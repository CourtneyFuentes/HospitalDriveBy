# Hospital Drive By

## By Hospital Drive By
### For BL-MSCH-C220 at Indiana University, Bloomington
### April 29th, 2020

This game was developed as a final project for C220 as part of a 48 hour game jam.

When we considered the theme of COVID-19, we thought about it this way: we should make something lighthearted and funny. Our "brain map" seemed to center around a few possible themes: zombies, lysol, the cure, hospitals, doctors, and nurses.

The technologies and resources we used: 
Godot,
Photoshop to create the background image, Piksel to create the sprites,
Ogg Vorbis file for background music used from patrickdearteaga.com

This is the objective of the game: 
Shoot the zombies with disinfectant to cure them and stop them from infecting you! If a zombie hits you it decreases your score and could cause you to lose the game. Save the doctors and nurses before the zombies get them to increase your score.

This is how the game is played: 
WASD controls movement, Space bar shoots the disinfectant

Struggles we encountered:
The main struggle we had was the time contraint. As we all have other classes and this is the end of the year this is already a busy time for all of us. 

Future plans: 
In the future the game may have more enemies, a title screen, be more than one level (perhaps the levels go up the hospital floors)
