# Hospital Drive By

## By Hospital Drive By
### For BL-MSCH-C220 at Indiana University, Bloomington
### April 29th, 2020

This game was developed as a final project for C220 as part of a 48 hour game jam.

When we considered the theme of COVID-19, we thought about it this way: we should make something lighthearted and funny. Our "brain map" seemed to center around a few possible themes: zombies, lysol, the cure, hospitals, doctors, and nurses.

The technologies and resources we used: 
Godot,
Photoshop to create the background image,
Ogg Vorbis file for background music used from patrickdearteaga.com

This is the objective of the game: 
Shoot the zombies with disinfectant to cure them and stop them from killing you!

This is how the game is played: 
WASD controls movement, Space bar shoots the disinfectant

Future plans:

### Team Members
 Tanner Chaille: Created sprites, added collision shapes to sprites, and created their animations
 Thomas McHugh: Coding
 Courtney Fuentes: Added background music, created the background picture, handled the repository
