What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

 I learned that animations can make a game seem so much better than using still images

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

 The player is put to the task of destroying little virus guys

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?

 Animated sprites

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?

 I'm not sure if this was intentional or not, but maybe making it so that the nuses dont disappear when they hit the virus guys

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 Most of the code made sense to me

Is it clear that every group member participated?

 Yes

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 Yes

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.

 The idea for this game was really good, and the music and animation of the sprites took it to a new level. good job :)
